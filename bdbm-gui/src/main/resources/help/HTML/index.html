	<h1>Welcome to the <i>BDBM</i> Help!</h1>
	<p align="center"><img src="Images/bdbm.png"/></p>
  
	<p><i>BDBM</i> (BLAST Database Manager) software was developed with the goal of providing an automatic and flexible tool for detecting positively selected sites given a set of unaligned nucleotide sequence data.<br/></p>
	
	<p>An example of the usefulness of such a pipeline is given by showing, under different conditions, positively selected amino acid sites in a set of 54 Coffea putative S-RNase sequences.</p>
	
	<p>This document is mean to serve as a guide for the practical use of <i>BDBM</i>. It includes 
	explanations of all of its functionalities in order to give a basic idea of usage.</p>
