  <h1><i>Merge Fasta</i></h1>
  <p>The sequences contained in different FASTA files can be merged even if they are not in the same order, as long as the sequence names are the same. This is a useful option when preparing files for phylogenetic analyses, for instance. Files are selected using the <i>ctrl</i> button.</p>
