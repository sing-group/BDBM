  <h1><i>Reformat FASTA</i></h1>
  <p>Very often FASTA files include fragmented sequences that are problematic for some (such as the <i>Splign-Compart</i> option, for instance) of the implemented operations but not for others. The <i>Reformat Fasta</i> option under <i>Operations</i> will remove those line breaks from FASTA files when the <i>Sequence fragment</i> length parameter is smaller than one. Changing the value of the <i>Sequence fragment</i> length parameter to a positive value will produce a FASTA file with sequences that are fragmented at the specified value, an option that may be useful when preparing FASTA files to be deposited elsewhere. The <i>SMART</i> option automatically extracts the gi (general identifier) codes. The <i>GENERIC</i> option extracts the information present in the fields that are delimited by the | symbol. The first field is number 0. The <i>PREFIX</i> option allows the incorporation of a prefix into all sequence names with the possibility of erasing or keeping the headers. When using the <i>Reformat Fasta</i> option the user must indicate whether the file contains nucleotide or protein sequences and the location of the file. The <i>Reformat Fasta</i> option can also be used by double clicking the right mouse button on top of a selected FASTA file.</p>
