  <h1><i>Import FASTA</i></h1>
  <p>Files can be imported using the <i>Import Fasta</i> option under <i>Operations</i>. Depending on whether the FASTA files are nucleotide or protein sequences, this operation will copy the selected files to either the /fasta/nucleotides/ or /fasta/proteins folder that is located in the specified repository folder. Moving the fasta files directly into these subfolders will have the same effect as using the <i>Import Fasta</i> option. When using the <i>Import Fasta</i> option, the user must indicate whether the file contains nucleotide or protein sequences and the location of the file. Remember that by double clicking on FASTA or output text files (but not BLAST-formatted files; see below) the user can look and search for regular expressions. Therefore, if unsure about the nature of a given FASTA file it is advisable to look at the files using this option.</p>
