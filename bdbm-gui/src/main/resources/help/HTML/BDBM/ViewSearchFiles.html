  <h1>Viewing and searching files</h1>
  <p>All text (such as FASTA) files can be viewed by double clicking on top of the selected file. The <i>Line wrap</i> checkbox allows the wrapping of the lines, an option that is useful when dealing with files with long text lines. The letter type and size can be changed in the <i>Change Font</i> pop-up menu. It is also possible to search for regular expressions. To find the next and previous hit use the <i>Next</i> and <i>Previous</i> buttons, respectively. The <i>Clear</i> button clears the search. Since genome and transcriptome files are usually very long only a fraction of the document is shown in the BDBM window. Different portions of the file can be viewed using the <i>Set Position</i> button.</p>
